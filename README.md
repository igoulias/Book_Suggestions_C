# Book_Suggestions_C

A program implemented in C that saves users, books they have read and their ratings for each book in lists. Then the program suggests to a buyer a book according to the saved "database". This is done by finding the user that has the most same preferences to the buyer. Then the program searches the books that the user has read and suggests the first one that the buyer has not read.
